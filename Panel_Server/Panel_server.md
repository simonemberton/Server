### Upload your project to external server

Here we’re going to use our Panel server.  Remember you're also using this to host your WordPress sites and you'll be using the same log in details.

Let's start by going to your individual webpage at `yourName.panel.uwe.ac.uk`. 

To get to the backend administration pages we just append `:2082` to the web address.

Sign in with your cPanel username and password.

Go to `File Manager` under `FILES`.

Open the `public_html` folder and create a new folder inside it.  You can name this anything you like, I’ve called mine p5.  This is where you are going to place your p5 project files.

Open the new folder and click on the `upload` button at the top of the page.  You can now drag in your project.  Include the p5.js file, your index.html file, sketch.js file and any data files (e.g. images and videos).  Make sure that the file paths are the same as those written in the index.html file.   

If you now open a new window in the browser and go to `yourName.panel.uwe.ac.uk/p5` you should be able to see your project.
